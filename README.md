# EMS - Electricity and Magnetism Simulations

This repository contains the code for an Electricity and Magnetism Simulations project. The project uses JavaFX to simulate 3 physics phenomena: Colomb's Law, Displacement of an electron in an electric field, and electric field simulation.

## Features
- Colomb's Law simulation
- Displacement of an electron in an electric field simulation
- Electric field simulation
- User-friendly interface using JavaFX

## Requirements
- Java 8 or later
- JavaFX

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/FehamIsmail/EMS-Project.git
```
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE and run the Main class.
3. Select the simulation you want to run from the menu.

## Customization
You can customize the simulation settings such as the number of charges and the strength of the electric field by editing the appropriate variables in the simulation classes.
